Use the <b>raspivid</b> program to generate the video stream and the <b>nc</b> program to send the stream out over a specific port.

For example, to stream 1280x720 video at 15 frames per second over port 5001, you would do:
<br><br>
raspivid -n -ih -t 0 -rot 0 -w 1280 -h 720 -b 1000000 -fps 15 -o - | nc -lkv4 5001</p>";
